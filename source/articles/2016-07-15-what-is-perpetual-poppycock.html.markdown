Do you ever have internal struggles with decisions or is indecision dominating your life? Well, that's me. In a nutshell, I am a chronically bad decision maker.

I suffer from sever *Perpetual Poppycock Syndrome*. This blog is my attempt to force recovery.

*Perpetual Poppycock Syndrome*, for me, is the loud, overbearing, incredibly judgmental, conversation in my head that interferes with every aspect of my life.

*Hey, Ashley, do you want to learn to play the guitar? Yes! I do! But when will I do that? Will I have enough time? Will I be any good? I don't music well, and that might cause me to be a terrible guitar player. I shouldn't play. But I want to. Ok, I'll play. I'll start tomorrow? No not tomorrow, you have work and kids and dinner and you are in need of some serious physical activity. That reminds me...I need to exercise more. Ok, I'll do that! Tomorrow morning I'll get up early and workout. But I might be too tired if I do that. I better not do that. I am so busy already that adding one more thing will just be too much. But I really need to lose 100+ pounds. I will feel better, look better...Ok, I'm working out in the morning! But then I might not feel like playing guitar. I better learn to play the guitar and then figure out how to exercise another time...oh yeah, I still need to work and take care of my family and try to be interested in what the kids are saying about some show they are watching...they should be moving more. Maybe we should play outside...blah blah blah...*

AAHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Will that guy ever shut up??? So far, the answer is no.

*Perpetual Poppycock Syndrome*, or PPS as I'll refer to it henceforth, plays out daily, monthly, yearly with everything in my life. There is so much I want to do, or try or say, but PPS enables indecision and thus creates the debilitating state I'm in now. I'm over that! Enough is enough.

This blog is my attempt to document all the things I say I want to do, and actually do! I can't wait to see how this goes.

Wish me luck!
