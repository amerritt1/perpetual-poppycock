It seems almost impossible to believe but I have been doing low carb, almost every day, for 3.5 months. That has to be some kind of all time life achievement for me. I do not do anything long term. I am a quitter, generally speaking and as you know I suffer severly from *PPS*.

This is truly a NSV and even more than that, a testament to going the distance and going for goal. I sound a bit romantic about this who thing but I'm really impressed with myself. It has been almost 4 months and I have taken very few days off from low carb and keto.

Here is what I've been doing that has helped me shed 40 pounds.

Most days I eat fewer than 20 grams of carbs per day. I try to eat the keto way of balancing macros but it is usually what they call lazy keto. I don't know if I'm just avoiding the actual calculating or what but low carb is working so that is what I do while keeping a loose total of fat and protein in my head. Its working so I'm not changing.

Since starting this process I have taken off on the following days: Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Day and January 2, Feb 4 and 5, Feb 22-26. Today is February 27 and I am back in the saddle, happily I might add. I enjoyed a few carefree days but was looking forward to removing the sugar again. That is completely unlike me! What has happened??

The second part of my plan starts today as well. Its time to incorporate exercise. That might sound awful for some but it is actually something I enjoy. My only complaint is time. I have very little time.

I'm a full time, working mom of two. I have a house, a husband and a dog in addition to the two kids. This does not make me unique. In fact, it lumps me into the majority. I just don't like how little time I actually have.

One thing I refuse to do, at this point, is to give up any of the limited time that I have with my kids. I only see them for an hour in the morning and then from 5 to 8 p.m. every evening. Those hours are marked as theirs and I will not negotiate that. So that leaves me the early morning hours of 4:30-6 a.m. and late night hours of 8:30-10p.m. to fit in cleaning, exercise, couple time and some personal time. That sounds overwhelming. But its something I need to do to take my health to the next level. So here is my game plan.

I know I'll probably make some adjustments to this as I try it out but for now this is what I'm thinking.

Every morning my internal clock tends to wake me up between 5 and 5:30 a.m. I roll over, look at my phone, check the video monitor and then promptly go back to sleep for 30 minutes to an hour. I think this would be my best opportunity to fit in some personal time. My kids are extremely light sleepers. If they hear me roll over in bed, they pop up and say my name. So while I'd like to exercise during this time, I think its best that I use it for a quiet activity. That will probably just be my time to play on my phone but I'll take it! I don't get more than 5 minutes uninterrupted normally so it will be a nice treat to have an hour.

In the evenings after bedtime, I will start exercising. I have a few workouts printed out so I know what I will be doing. I think I can do a little cardio and some strength training in 45-60 minutes starting at 9 p.m. That means I have 30 minutes after I put the kids to be to clean/prep for the next day before I workout. I'm sure this will be a very fluid timeline and I wont always get to do it at exactly those times, but its a good guide.

After I exercise, I can do any beauty ritual I want, i.e., shower, and then chat with my husband for, as my daughter would say, a few whiles before I pass out. My ultimate goal will be to be asleep before 11. That is doable I think!
