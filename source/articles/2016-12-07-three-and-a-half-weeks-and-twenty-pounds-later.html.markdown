I did something. Something drastic, and extreme, and crazy, and totally unlike me. But, I did it.

The most amazing thing has happened. I woke up 3.5 weeks ago, the week before Thanksgiving otherwise known as the eating holiday, and I did a complete diet overhaul. I went keto like a m&$%^) f&^$#@! (That's slang for I removed carbs and sugar from my diet in an extreme way)

I did not hesitate. I did not tip-toe in. I did not do my usual internal fight with *PPS*. I just did it. It was that easy. And its been so right on.

Background: I'm a fatty. I've always been a fatty. I love to eat. I don't want to spend too much time explaining because I feel like my people out there know what it is and means to be a fatty. I will not say one word about genetics or lifestyle or any other something that lends itself to explaining why I'm a fatty. I am the old school version. The one who eats too much of the yummy, sugary stuff while barely moving a muscle all day. That is me. THE Fatty. Captain Fatty. Fat fat water rat...that guy. And to date, its been ok. But things were changing and therefore, so did I.

It's been 3.5 weeks and I'm down 21 pounds. ***MIND BLOWN*** It has been the easiest weight loss I've ever experienced, and its addictive.

I have no idea how long this change will last or if I'll be able to stick with it as a lifestyle long term. Honestly, I'm not even thinking in terms like that. All I'm doing is thinking about today, and a few days out. Somehow, that is working.
