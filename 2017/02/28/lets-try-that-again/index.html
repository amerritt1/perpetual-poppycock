<section class='post-content'><p>Full on <em>PPS</em> attack last night. Not only did I totally bail on any plans to work out after bedtime, I also did not even attempt personal time this morning due to an untimely bathroom break for my fur baby. Willy decided to wake up the entire house at 4:30 a.m. so he could go outside. After that, I spent an hour getting my human babies back to sleep and at that point, I just cat napped for 30 minutes before I had to get up and start the day.</p>

<p>This morning was a bit of a fluke so we can disregard that as part of my <em>PPS</em> but last night was just ridiculous. I must have talked myself in and out of exercising a dozen times.</p>

<p><em>Looks like the kids will not go to bed on time tonight. I better wait and work out in the morning. No, I better work out tonight no matter how late it is because tomorrow morning the kids might be in bad moods. And what if they wake up during the night and I&rsquo;m too tired? So yes, I&rsquo;ll work out tonight. But, its kind of rainy outside. Where can I work out that would not include me be attacked by hundreds of gallinippers?&hellip;and on and on and on</em></p>

<p>The way to insure that my plans won&rsquo;t play out as expected is to inject any amount of time, no matter how short, between conceiving plan and executing plan. That is a total plan killer. And, to no one&rsquo;s surprise, my plans did not pan out.</p>

<p>So now, I am back at it again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to flip it up. Tonight, after bedtime, I will actively ask myself if I would like some personal time or some exercise. This will hopefully cut back on the back and forth with what the plan is. I&rsquo;m going to outsmart my <em>PPS</em>! </p>
