<section class='post-content'><p>I did something. Something drastic, and extreme, and crazy, and totally unlike me. But, I did it.</p>

<p>The most amazing thing has happened. I woke up 3.5 weeks ago, the week before Thanksgiving otherwise known as the eating holiday, and I did a complete diet overhaul. I went keto like a m&amp;$%^) f&amp;^$#@! (That&rsquo;s slang for I removed carbs and sugar from my diet in an extreme way)</p>

<p>I did not hesitate. I did not tip-toe in. I did not do my usual internal fight with <em>PPS</em>. I just did it. It was that easy. And its been so right on.</p>

<p>Background: I&rsquo;m a fatty. I&rsquo;ve always been a fatty. I love to eat. I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time explaining because I feel like my people out there know what it is and means to be a fatty. I will not say one word about genetics or lifestyle or any other something that lends itself to explaining why I&rsquo;m a fatty. I am the old school version. The one who eats too much of the yummy, sugary stuff while barely moving a muscle all day. That is me. THE Fatty. Captain Fatty. Fat fat water rat&hellip;that guy. And to date, its been ok. But things were changing and therefore, so did I.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been 3.5 weeks and I&rsquo;m down 21 pounds. <strong><em>MIND BLOWN</em></strong> It has been the easiest weight loss I&rsquo;ve ever experienced, and its addictive.</p>

<p>I have no idea how long this change will last or if I&rsquo;ll be able to stick with it as a lifestyle long term. Honestly, I&rsquo;m not even thinking in terms like that. All I&rsquo;m doing is thinking about today, and a few days out. Somehow, that is working.</p>
