<section class='post-content'><p>Do you ever have internal struggles with decisions or is indecision dominating your life? Well, that&rsquo;s me. In a nutshell, I am a chronically bad decision maker.</p>

<p>I suffer from sever <em>Perpetual Poppycock Syndrome</em>. This blog is my attempt to force recovery.</p>

<p><em>Perpetual Poppycock Syndrome</em>, for me, is the loud, overbearing, incredibly judgmental, conversation in my head that interferes with every aspect of my life.</p>

<p><em>Hey, Ashley, do you want to learn to play the guitar? Yes! I do! But when will I do that? Will I have enough time? Will I be any good? I don&rsquo;t music well, and that might cause me to be a terrible guitar player. I shouldn&rsquo;t play. But I want to. Ok, I&rsquo;ll play. I&rsquo;ll start tomorrow? No not tomorrow, you have work and kids and dinner and you are in need of some serious physical activity. That reminds me&hellip;I need to exercise more. Ok, I&rsquo;ll do that! Tomorrow morning I&rsquo;ll get up early and workout. But I might be too tired if I do that. I better not do that. I am so busy already that adding one more thing will just be too much. But I really need to lose 100+ pounds. I will feel better, look better&hellip;Ok, I&rsquo;m working out in the morning! But then I might not feel like playing guitar. I better learn to play the guitar and then figure out how to exercise another time&hellip;oh yeah, I still need to work and take care of my family and try to be interested in what the kids are saying about some show they are watching&hellip;they should be moving more. Maybe we should play outside&hellip;blah blah blah&hellip;</em></p>

<p>AAHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Will that guy ever shut up??? So far, the answer is no.</p>

<p><em>Perpetual Poppycock Syndrome</em>, or PPS as I&rsquo;ll refer to it henceforth, plays out daily, monthly, yearly with everything in my life. There is so much I want to do, or try or say, but PPS enables indecision and thus creates the debilitating state I&rsquo;m in now. I&rsquo;m over that! Enough is enough.</p>

<p>This blog is my attempt to document all the things I say I want to do, and actually do! I can&rsquo;t wait to see how this goes.</p>

<p>Wish me luck!</p>
